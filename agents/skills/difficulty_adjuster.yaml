    - For hardware experience:
      * beginner: Avoid complex setup instructions, provide alternatives
      * intermediate: Include moderate setup details
      * advanced: Include detailed technical specifications
    - For learning styles:
      * visual: Add descriptive imagery, diagrams (described in text)
      * auditory: Include discussion points, sound-based analogies
